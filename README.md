# F90transpose
Basic Fortran 90 Program to Calculate Matrix Transpose

To run in Linux terminal:

$ gfortran transpose_matrix.f90 </br>
$ ./a.out </br>

Will display original matrix as entered into mat.txt, and the transpose of the matrix.  Not generalized yet - but easy to figure out if needed (change dimensions and do loop for i=n).
